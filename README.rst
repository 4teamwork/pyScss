About
=====
xCSS for Python is a superset of CSS that is more powerful, elegant and easier
to maintain than plain-vanilla CSS. The framework works as a CSS source code
preprocesor which allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, and extend
classes, all with a CSS-compatible syntax which the preprocessor then compiles
to standard CSS.

xCSS, as an extension of CSS, helps keep large stylesheets well-organized. It
borrows concepts and functionality from projects such as OOCSS and other similar
frameworks like as Sass. It's build on top of the original PHP xCSS codebase
structure but it's been completely rewritten and many bugs have been fixed.
