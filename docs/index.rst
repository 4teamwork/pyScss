   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

pyScss, a Sass compiler for Python
==================================

pyScss compiles Scss (Sass), a superset of CSS that is more powerful, elegant
and easier to maintain than plain-vanilla CSS. The library acts as a CSS source
code preprocesor which allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, and
have inheritance of rules, all with a CSS-compatible syntax which the
preprocessor then compiles to standard CSS.

Scss, as an extension of CSS, helps keep large stylesheets well-organized. It
borrows concepts and functionality from projects such as OOCSS and other similar
frameworks like as Sass. It's build on top of the original PHP xCSS codebase
structure but it's been completely rewritten, many bugs have been fixed and it
has been extensively extended to support almost the full range of Sass' Scss
syntax and functionality.
